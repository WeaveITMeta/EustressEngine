Respected Prime Minister,

I write to bring to your urgent attention that the Indo-Gangetic Basin aquifer — ranked the #1 most critically depleted aquifer on Earth — is approaching irreversible collapse within one to two decades in the most stressed zones of Western Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana. This aquifer sustains 750 million people and irrigates 500,000 km² of India's most productive agricultural land.

**The core failure:** Annual pumping (~60 km³) exceeds monsoon recharge (~45 km³) by approximately 15 km³/year. The Ganga and Yamuna rivers, which historically recharged the aquifer, are legally fully allocated — barrages at Bijnor, Narora, and Wazirabad divert all dry-season flow to canals. Zero natural recharge reaches the aquifer for 8 months of the year.

**The governance failure:** India does not know its own pumping rate. Millions of private tube wells are unmetered. CGWB published estimates vary 5–20× between studies. GRACE-FO satellite data confirms mass loss but cannot resolve sub-basin spatial detail. Without accurate data, no rational infrastructure investment is possible.

**I respectfully request three immediate policy actions:**

1. **National Tube Well Metering Programme (P0):** Mandate metering of all tube wells in the IGB basin within 3 years. Without consumption data, the true overdraft rate — and therefore the scale of any remediation — is unknown by a factor of 4×.

2. **Independent Overdraft Audit:** Commission an independent audit using GRACE-FO Level-3 Mascon products cross-referenced with CGWB primary well-level data to establish the true net overdraft rate to ±10% accuracy, disaggregated by district.

3. **Minimum Environmental Flow Enforcement:** Enforce the 5,000 cusecs (~142 m³/s) minimum environmental flow requirement from Narora to Farakka during the dry season, as currently mandated but not met.

The engineering solutions exist. India's Namami Gange programme provides institutional infrastructure. But no infrastructure commitment is rational until the data gaps above are closed. The single most important action is establishing the true overdraft rate — this determines whether remediation is a ₹25,000 crore or ₹1,00,000 crore undertaking.

Aquifer collapse is not a political event. It is a geological one. It does not negotiate.

Respectfully submitted.
